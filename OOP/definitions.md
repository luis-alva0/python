### Class
- A template.
- Defines the abstract caracteristics of a thing (object), including the thing's
characteristics (its attributes, fields or properties) and the thing's behaviors
(the this it can do, or methods, operations or features). One might say that a
class is a blueprint or factory that describes the nature of something. For example,
the class Dog would consist of traits shared by all dogs, such as breed and fur color
(characteristics), and the ability to bark and sit (behaviours). 

### Method
- A defined capability of a class.
- An object's abilities. In language, methods are verbs. Lassie, being a Dog, has the
ability to bark. So bark() is one of Lassie's methods. She may have other methods as
well, for example sit() or eat() or walk() or save_timmy(). Within the program, using
a method usually affects only one particular object; all Dogs can bark, but you need
only one particular dog to do the barking. 

### Attribute
- A bit of data in a class

### Object
- A particular instance of a class.
- One can have an instance of a class or a particular object. The instance is the actual
object created at runtime. In programmer jargon, the Lassie object is an instance of the
Dog class. The set of values of the attributes of a particular object is called its state.
The object consists of a state and the behavior that's defined in the object's class. 

### Constructor
- Code that runs when an object is created.

### Inheritance
- The ability to extend a class to make a new class.
